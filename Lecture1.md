## What is object oriented programming?

OOP is a group of data attributes with functions into a unit thats called an object. Every OOP languages is class based, that means that the classes defines the data attributes.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

The basic concepts of OOP is Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Ploymorphism. 

## What are the main principles of OOP?

They main principles is 

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a way to hide information. Its forming a protective barrier around the information contained within a class from the rest of the code. For example;
If we have a person class, we can hide the social security number from the rest of the code because its private and should not be exposed to other objects in the program. Its other ways to get access the SocialSecurityNumber but for the most part, its hidden from program. The personâ€™s private data would be well encapsulated in such a class.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is... -- Its in the middle of inheritance og encapsulation. We will take the useable part. example -- import numpy as np in pynthon. Numpy is a abstraction in the code. an open source.
A natural extension of encapsulation. If you use facebook, you will see a GUI. 
Importance of abstraction --> prevents code repetition, improves flexibility and working in larger teams. 

## Inheritance

Inheritance is --- keyword subclasses takes from parent class. it makes new classes of existed classes.The attributes is overwrited. The advantegs of inheritance -- 
Modular code base -- it will ttake you extra long time to finish the code. 3 

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is... ----->>  when you can make subclasses of the superclass. The advantegts of that is that you can
